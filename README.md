### Requirements

To run the C++ solution you will need to have GCC 12.x and CMake 3.22.x installed on your system. On Ubuntu 22.04 you can install GCC and set it as default compiler using the following commands:

```
sudo apt install g++-12 gcc-12 cmake
sudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-11 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-12 120
sudo update-alternatives --remove-all g++
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-11 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-12 120
```

To run the Java solution you will need to have Java 1.7.x and Maven 3.6.x installed on your systems. On Ubuntu 22.04 you can install Java and Maven using the following commands:

```
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk maven

```

### C++ solution
#### How to build/compile

To build the C++ solution use the following commands:
```
cd app-cpp
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

#### How to run application

To run the C++ solution (after you build the project) use the following command:
```
./build/run-tasks <number of worker threads> <number of tasks>
```

#### Example

```
./build/run-tasks 4 10
Worker 3 completed task 2 (5229506)
Worker 2 completed task 1 (6932)
Worker 4 completed task 3 (7238558)
Worker 1 completed task 0 (9350910)
Worker 2 completed task 5 (5918333)
Worker 4 completed task 6 (7941609)
Worker 3 completed task 4 (5570009)
Worker 1 completed task 7 (7588356)
Worker 2 completed task 8 (2550421)
Worker 4 completed task 9 (3824327)
```

### Java solution
#### How to build/compile

To build the Java solution use the following commands:
```
cd app-java
mvn compile
mvn package
```

#### How to run application

To run the Java solution (after you build the project) use the following command:
```
java -cp target/app-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar csc435.app.RunTasks <number of worker threads> <number of tasks>
```

#### Example

```
java -cp target/app-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar csc435.app.RunTasks 4 10
Worker 1 completed task 1 (6536490)
Worker 4 completed task 3 (9865992)
Worker 2 completed task 2 (6708618)
Worker 3 completed task 4 (1148802)
Worker 3 completed task 8 (1052421)
Worker 2 completed task 7 (3324156)
Worker 1 completed task 5 (2000304)
Worker 4 completed task 6 (4927527)
Worker 3 completed task 9 (2324344)
Worker 2 completed task 10 (9686705)
```
